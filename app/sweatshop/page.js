          copy={"I few years prior to my involvement with the project, Sweatshop was acquired by SportsDirect. Unfortunately in the years that followed other sites took priority and Sweatshop was left to slowly become obsolete. However Sweatshop still had a loyal customer base that has been a part of the Sweatshop journey for decades, therefore my team and I were brought on to breathe some life into their business and push Sweatshop up to modern ecommerce standards. This would involve everything from social strategy, branding and their website."}

We also changed the site to full width for most users which gave the design a more immersive feel, this added with the larger images really changed the whole look of the site."}

Add to basket and each point through the checkout process is absolutely key, giving the site a facelift may have been a goal for the stakeholders but for our team we really wanted to make the site work more fluently for the users, therefore we set ourselves internal KPIs around conversion and drop-off. Although we improved on metrics such as exit and bounce rate I was most proud of our work done to the purchase journey. As a result of our changes we upped the conversion rate from 2.55% to 3.34%. We reduced payment drop-off to 7% from 10% and our biggest difference was the confirmation drop-off which we reduced by 12% which was quite high at 38%."}
